<!-- REFLECTION -->
## Reflection

* My intial idea was to provide users with a playlist by city to play within the app. Unfortunately, I came accross lots of issues with picking a proper API for the functionality. Due to time contraint, The app extendes as for as fetching data from the database and display trending music by country. I would like to work on adding a music API that will provide users options of playlist to play within the app.
